Welcome to our DBT Mobility project!

### Why DBT ?

We use this data engineering tool to serve scrapped data to Data Analysts.
DBT allow us to retrieve src tables (raw data) from the DWH in BigQuery (datawarehouse).
The transformation is divided into 3 steps:
- "Source": source tables (raw data)
- "Staging": transition tables: views
- "Mart: usable tables for BI and visualization

### Using the Data engineering: Mobility project
